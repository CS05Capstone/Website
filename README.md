# NSW Youth Justice Chart
Welcome to NSW Youth Justice Chart repository. We are the group SOFT3888_W16_04. This is a desktop and mobile application, which will help young people who have conflict with law to get participate in some educational programs and activities! 

We planed to finish the application in 3-4 months by using Extreme Programming(i.e. XP). To make everyone get family with each XP role, we are going to change the responsibility of each member. 

Here is our roles allocation form.

![XP roles 6-13.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/r7Bjkea/images/1789635636-XP%20roles%206-13.png)

Our Wiki will introduce and record all the technique and non-technique information related about the project, especially about how to start on our application, how does the application inplement and how do we practice project management and Extreme Programming.

This application uses Sprintboot MVP frame to construct the backend code. The PC frontend is based on the react-typescript, and the mobile frontend is based on the react-native. Make sure you have configured the envrionment before running.

## Start
To start our application, you need clone our repository first:

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/soft3888_w16_04/chart-yjnsw.git
```

Then you need to open the folder "SpringBackEnd2", then run it.

We only have one way to run the program for now. But soon we will develop an executable file to run the program.

# Setting up the environment for developing and running the mobile application 

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and building the mobile app for CHART.

## Node & Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install node
  brew install watchman
   ```
If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 16 or newer.

Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

## Installing dependencies for IOS

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Xcode and CocoaPods.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

### Xcode

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 10 or newer.

### Command Line Tools

You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose Settings... (or Preferences...) from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

### Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode

To install a simulator, open Xcode > Settings... (or Preferences...) and select the Platforms (or Components) tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is one of the dependency management system available for iOS. CocoaPods is a Ruby gem. You can install CocoaPods using the version of Ruby that ships with the latest version of macOS.

For more information, please visit CocoaPods Getting Started guide.

## Running Your React Native Application

### Step 1: Start Metro

First, you need to initiate Metro, the JavaScript bundler that is included with React Native. Metro's primary function is to take an entry file and various options, ultimately returning a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies.

To commence Metro, execute the following command within your React Native project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

While Metro Bundler is running in its dedicated terminal, you can launch your React Native application. Open a new terminal within your React Native project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run ios
```

This command will initiate your app and, in a brief moment, you'll see it running in the iOS Simulator.

This is one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode.

## Installing dependencies for Android

### Java Development Kit

We recommend installing the OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask zulu11
# Get path to where cask was installed to double-click installer
brew info --cask zulu11
```

After you install the JDK, update your JAVA_HOME environment variable. If you used above steps, JDK will likely be at /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home

The Zulu OpenJDK distribution offers JDKs for both Intel and M1 Macs. This will make sure your builds are faster on M1 Macs compared to using an Intel-based JDK.

If you have already installed JDK on your system, we recommend JDK 11. You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions.

### Android development environment

Setting up your Android development environment can be somewhat cumbersome, especially if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few configurations you might need to adjust. In any case, please carefully follow the next steps.

### 1. Install Android Studio
Download and install Android Studio. During the Android Studio installation wizard, ensure that the following items are checked:

   - Android SDK
   - Android SDK Platform
   - Android Virtual Device

   Then, click "Next" to proceed with the installation of these components.


### 2. Install the Android SDK

   Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the Android 13 (Tiramisu) SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.
   
   To do that, open Android Studio, click on "More Actions" button and select "SDK Manager".


#### SDK Platforms

1. Open the "SDK Manager" and select the "SDK Platforms" tab.
2. Check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner.
3. Find and expand the "Android 13 (Tiramisu)" entry and ensure the following items are checked:
   - Android SDK Platform 33
   - Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image or Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image (or for Apple M1 Silicon, Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image).

#### SDK Tools

4. Switch to the "SDK Tools" tab.
5. Check the box next to "Show Package Details."
6. Find and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry and make sure that version 33.0.0 is selected.

7. Click "Apply" to initiate the download and installation of the Android SDK and related build tools.

### 3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME Environment Variable

The React Native tools require specific environment variables to be configured for building apps with native code. Follow these steps:

1. Add the following lines to your `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` if using Bash) config file:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

## Running Your React Native Application

### Step 1: Start Metro

First, you need to initiate Metro, the JavaScript bundler that is included with React Native. Metro's primary function is to take an entry file and various options, ultimately returning a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies.

To commence Metro, execute the following command within your React Native project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

While Metro Bundler is running in its dedicated terminal, you can launch your React Native application. Open a new terminal within your React Native project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.

This is one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.
